//STBTT_DEF void stbtt_FreeSDF(unsigned char *bitmap, void *userdata);

//STBTT_DEF unsigned char * stbtt_GetGlyphSDF(const stbtt_fontinfo *info, float scale, int glyph, int padding, unsigned char onedge_value, float pixel_dist_scale, int *width, int *height, int *xoff, int *yoff);

// These functions compute a discretized SDF field for a single character, suitable for storing
// in a single-channel texture, sampling with bilinear filtering, and testing against
// larger than some threshold to produce scalable fonts.
//        info              --  the font
//        scale             --  controls the size of the resulting SDF bitmap, same as it would be creating a regular bitmap
//        glyph/codepoint   --  the character to generate the SDF for
//        padding           --  extra "pixels" around the character which are filled with the distance to the character (not 0),
//                                 which allows effects like bit outlines
//        onedge_value      --  value 0-255 to test the SDF against to reconstruct the character (i.e. the isocontour of the character)
//        pixel_dist_scale  --  what value the SDF should increase by when moving one SDF "pixel" away from the edge (on the 0..255 scale)
//                                 if positive, > onedge_value is inside; if negative, < onedge_value is inside
//        width,height      --  output height & width of the SDF bitmap (including padding)
//        xoff,yoff         --  output origin of the character
//        return value      --  a 2D array of bytes 0..255, width*height in size
//
// pixel_dist_scale & onedge_value are a scale & bias that allows you to make
// optimal use of the limited 0..255 for your application, trading off precision
// and special effects. SDF values outside the range 0..255 are clamped to 0..255.
//
// Example:
//      scale = stbtt_ScaleForPixelHeight(22)
//      padding = 5
//      onedge_value = 180
//      pixel_dist_scale = 180/5.0 = 36.0
//
//      This will create an SDF bitmap in which the character is about 22 pixels
//      high but the whole bitmap is about 22+5+5=32 pixels high. To produce a filled
//      shape, sample the SDF at each pixel and fill the pixel if the SDF value
//      is greater than or equal to 180/255. (You'll actually want to antialias,
//      which is beyond the scope of this example.) Additionally, you can compute
//      offset outlines (e.g. to stroke the character border inside & outside,
//      or only outside). For example, to fill outside the character up to 3 SDF
//      pixels, you would compare against (180-36.0*3)/255 = 72/255. The above
//      choice of variables maps a range from 5 pixels outside the shape to
//      2 pixels inside the shape to 0..255; this is intended primarily for apply
//      outside effects only (the interior range is needed to allow proper
//      antialiasing of the font at *smaller* sizes)
//
// The function computes the SDF analytically at each SDF pixel, not by e.g.
// building a higher-res bitmap and approximating it. In theory the quality
// should be as high as possible for an SDF of this size & representation, but
// unclear if this is true in practice (perhaps building a higher-res bitmap
// and computing from that can allow drop-out prevention).
//
// The algorithm has not been optimized at all, so expect it to be slow
// if computing lots of characters or very large sizes.
