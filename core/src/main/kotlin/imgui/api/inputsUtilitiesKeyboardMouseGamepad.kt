// Inputs Utilities: Keyboard/Mouse/Gamepad
// - the ImGuiKey enum contains all possible keyboard, mouse and gamepad inputs (e.g. ImGuiKey_A, ImGuiKey_MouseLeft, ImGuiKey_GamepadDpadUp...).
// - before v1.87, we used ImGuiKey to carry native/user indices as defined by each backends. About use of those legacy ImGuiKey values:
//  - without IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO (legacy support): you can still use your legacy native/user indices (< 512) according to how your backend/engine stored them in io.KeysDown[], but need to cast them to ImGuiKey.
//  - with    IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO (this is the way forward): any use of ImGuiKey will assert with key < 512. GetKeyIndex() is pass-through and therefore deprecated (gone if IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO is defined).
