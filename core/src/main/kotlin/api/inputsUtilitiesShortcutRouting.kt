// Inputs Utilities: Shortcut testing (with Routing Resolution)
// - ImGuiKeyChord = a ImGuiKey optionally OR-red with ImGuiMod_Alt/ImGuiMod_Ctrl/ImGuiMod_Shift/ImGuiMod_Super/ImGuiMod_Shortcut.
//     ImGuiKey_C                 (accepted by functions taking ImGuiKey or ImGuiKeyChord)
//     ImGuiKey_C | ImGuiMod_Ctrl (accepted by functions taking ImGuiKeyChord)
//   ONLY ImGuiMod_XXX values are legal to 'OR' with an ImGuiKey. You CANNOT 'OR' two ImGuiKey values.
// - The general idea of routing is that multiple locations may register interest in a shortcut,
//   and only one location will be granted access to the shortcut.
// - The default routing policy (ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFocused) checks for current window being in
//   the focus stack, and route the shortcut to the deepest requesting window in the focus stack.
// - Consider Shortcut() to be a widget: the calling location matters + it has side-effects as shortcut routes are
//   registered into the system (for it to be able to pick the best one). This is why this is not called 'IsShortcutPressed()'.
// - If this is called for a specific widget, pass its ID as 'owner_id' in order for key ownership and routing priorities
//   to be honored (e.g. with default ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFocused, the highest priority is given to active item).
