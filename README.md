----------

This is the Kotlin rewrite of [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (AKA ImGui), a bloat-free graphical user
interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled
application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (few external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and
visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward
this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen
applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are
non-standard.

Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few files that you can easily copy and compile into your application/engine.

It doesn't provide the guarantee that dear imgui provides, but it is actually a much better fit for java/kotlin users.

### Usage

Your code passes mouse/keyboard inputs and settings to Dear ImGui (see example applications for more details). After
ImGui is setup, you can use it like in this example:

##### Kotlin

```kotlin
with(ImGui) {
    text("Hello, world %d", 123)
    button("Save"){
        // do stuff
    }
    inputText("string", buf)
    sliderFloat("float", ::f, 0f, 1f)
}
```

##### Java

```java
imgui.text("Hello, world %d", 123);
if(imgui.button("Save")) {
    // do stuff
}
imgui.inputText("string", buf);
imgui.sliderFloat("float", f, 0f, 1f);
```

Result:

_(settings: Dark style (left), Light style (right) / Font: Roboto-Medium, 16px / Rounding: 5)_

Code:

```kotlin
// Create a window called "My First Tool", with a menu bar.
begin("My First Tool", ::myToolActive, WindowFlag.MenuBar)
menuBar {
    menu("File") {
        menuItem("Open..", "Ctrl+O")) { /* Do stuff */ }
        menuItem("Save", "Ctrl+S"))   { /* Do stuff */ }
        menuItem("Close", "Ctrl+W"))  { myToolActive = false }
    }
}

// Edit a color (stored as FloatArray[4] or Vec4)
colorEdit4("Color", myColor);

// Plot some values
val myValues = floatArrayOf( 0.2f, 0.1f, 1f, 0.5f, 0.9f, 2.2f )
plotLines("Frame Times", myValues)
 
// Display contents in a scrolling region
textColored(Vec4(1,1,0,1), "Important Stuff")
withChild("Scrolling") {
    for (int n = 0; n < 50; n++)
        text("%04d: Some text", n)
}
end()
```

Result:

### How it works

Check out the References section if you want to understand the core principles behind the IMGUI paradigm. An IMGUI tries
to minimize state duplication, state synchronization and state storage from the user's point of view. It is less error
prone (less code and less bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to create dynamic user
interfaces.

Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw
calls and state changes is typically very small. Because it doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call
ImGui commands anywhere in your code (e.g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering
process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate dear imgui with
your existing codebase.

_A common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode gui for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies
hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the gui functions are called. This
is NOT what Dear ImGui does. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches
your GPU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even
remotely._

Dear ImGui allows you create elaborate tools as well as very short-lived ones. On the extreme side of short-liveness:
using the Edit&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweaks variables
while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values. You
can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection
data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a
logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game making editor/framework, etc.

### Demo

You should be able to try the examples from `test` (tested on Windows/Mac/Linux) within minutes. If you can't, let me
know!

OpenGL:

- [Kotlin](gl/src/test/kotlin/examples/opengl3.kt)
- [Java](gl/src/test/java/imgui/examples/OpenGL3.java)

Vulkan:

- Kotlin:

    - [VKÂ²](vk/src/test/kotlin/imguiVk/vulkan.kt)

    - [LWJGL vanilla](vk/src/test/kotlin/imguiVk_/vulkan_.kt)
- Java:
  - PR me!

You should refer to those also to learn how to use the imgui library.

The demo applications are unfortunately not yet DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For DPI awareness
you can load/reload your font at different scale, and scale your Style with `style.ScaleAllSizes()`.

Ps: `DEBUG = false` to turn off debugs `println()`

### Functional Programming / Domain Specific Language

All the functions are ported exactly as the original. Moreover, in order to take advantage of Functional Programming
this port offers some comfortable constructs, giving the luxury to forget about some annoying and very error prone
burden code such as the ending `*Pop()`, `*end()` and so on.

These constructs shine especially in Kotlin, where they are also inlined.

Let's take an original cpp sample and let's see how we can make it nicer:

```cpp
    if (ImGui::TreeNode("Querying Status (Active/Focused/Hovered etc.)")) {            
        ImGui::Checkbox("Hovered/Active tests after Begin() for title bar testing", &test_window);
        if (test_window) {            
            ImGui::Begin("Title bar Hovered/Active tests", &test_window);
            if (ImGui::BeginPopupContextItem()) // <-- This is using IsItemHovered() {                
                if (ImGui::MenuItem("Close")) { test_window = false; }
                ImGui::EndPopup();
            }
            ImGui::Text("whatever\n");
            ImGui::End();
        }
        ImGui::TreePop();
    }
```

This may become in Kotlin:

```kotlin
    treeNode("Querying Status (Active/Focused/Hovered etc.)") {            
        checkbox("Hovered/Active tests after Begin() for title bar testing", ::test_window)
        if (test_window)
            window ("Title bar Hovered/Active tests", ::test_window) {
                popupContextItem { // <-- This is using IsItemHovered() {                    
                    menuItem("Close") { test_window = false }
                }
                text("whatever\n")
            }
    }
```

Or in Java:

```java
    treeNode("Querying Status (Active/Focused/Hovered etc.)", () -> {            
        checkbox("Hovered/Active tests after Begin() for title bar testing", test_window)
        if (test_window[0])
            window ("Title bar Hovered/Active tests", test_window, () -> {
                popupContextItem(() -> { // <-- This is using IsItemHovered() {                    
                    menuItem("Close", () -> test_window = false);
                });
                text("whatever\n");
            });
    });
```

The demo mixes some traditional imgui-calls with these DSL calls.

Refer to the corresponding [`dsl`](src/main/kotlin/imgui/dsl.kt) object for Kotlin
or [`dsl_`](src/main/java/imgui/dsl_.java) class for Java.

### Native Roadmap

Some of the goals of Omar for 2018 are:

- Finish work on gamepad/keyboard controls. (see #787)
- Finish work on viewports and multiple OS windows management. (see #1542)
- Finish work on docking, tabs. (see #351)
- Make Columns better. (they are currently pretty terrible!)
- Make the examples look better, improve styles, improve font support, make the examples hi-DPI aware.

### Rewrite Roadmap

- finish to rewrite the last few remaining methods
- make text input and handling robust (copy/cut/undo/redo and text filters)
- hunt down bugs

### How to retrieve it:

You can find all the instructions by [mary](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/mary)

ImGui does not impose any platform specific dependency. Therefor users must specify runtime dependencies themselves.
This should
be done with great care to ensure that the dependencies versions do not conflict.

Using Gradle with the following workaround is recommended to keep the manual maintenance cost low.

```groovy
import org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem

repositories {
    ...
    maven("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kotlin-graphics/mary/master")
}

dependencies {
    /*
    Each renderer will need different dependencies.
    Each one needs core.
    OpenGL needs "gl", "glfw"
    Vulkan needs "vk", "glfw"
    JOGL needs "jogl"
    OpenJFX needs "openjfx"
    
    To get all the dependencies in one sweep, create an array of the strings needed and loop through them like below.
    Any number of renderers can be added to the project like this however, you could all all of them with the array ["gl", "glfw", "core", "vk", "jogl", "openjfx"] 
    This example gets the OpenGL needed modules.
     */
    implementation("kotlin.graphics:imgui-core:1.79+05")
    implementation("kotlin.graphics:imgui-gl:1.79+05")
    implementation("kotlin.graphics:imgui-glfw:1.79+05")
	
    /*switch ( OperatingSystem.current() ) {
        case OperatingSystem.WINDOWS:
            ext.lwjglNatives = "natives-windows"
            break
        case OperatingSystem.LINUX:
            ext.lwjglNatives = "natives-linux"
            break
        case OperatingSystem.MAC_OS:
            ext.lwjglNatives = "natives-macos"
            break
    }

    // Look up which modules and versions of LWJGL are required and add setup the approriate natives.
    configurations.compile.resolvedConfiguration.getResolvedArtifacts().forEach {
        if (it.moduleVersion.id.group == "org.lwjgl") {
            runtime "org.lwjgl:${it.moduleVersion.id.name}:${it.moduleVersion.id.version}:${lwjglNatives}"
        }
    }*/
}
```

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/wiki/Install) for a more detailed guide and for
other
systems (such as Maven, Sbt or Leiningen).

Note: total repo size is around 24.1 MB, but there are included 22.6 MB of assets (mainly fonts), this means that the
actual size is around 1.5 MB. I always thought a pairs of tens of MB is negligible, but if this is not your case, then
just clone and throw away the fonts you don't need or pick up the `imgui-light` jar from the
[release page](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/releases). Thanks to [chrjen](https://github.com/chrjen) for
that.

### LibGdx

On the initiative to Catvert, ImGui plays now nice also with LibGdx.

Simply follow this [short wiki](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/wiki/Using-libGDX) on how to set it up.

Developed by [Omar Cornut](http://www.miracleworld.net) and every direct or indirect contributors to the GitHub. The
early version of this library was developed with the support of [Media Molecule](http://www.mediamolecule.com) and first
used internally on the game [Tearaway](http://tearaway.mediamolecule.com).

Omar first discovered imgui principles at [Q-Games](http://www.q-games.com) where Atman had dropped his own simple imgui
implementation in the codebase, which Omar spent quite some time improving and thinking about. It turned out that Atman
was exposed to the concept directly by working with Casey. When Omar moved to Media Molecule he rewrote a new library
trying to overcome the flaws and limitations of the first one he's worked with. It became this library and since then
he (and me) has spent an unreasonable amount of time iterating on it.
